To launch the Fashionista-Media project - you'll need to follow this tutorial:

Clone the Repository:
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
git clone https://github.com/EmilijaPaleckyte/Fashionista-Media.git

After cloning the Fashionista-Media repository to your local machine, you can start it using a live server. Here's how you can do it:

1. Navigate to the Cloned Directory:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the Fashionista-Media repository.
   You can do this using the `cd` command:
   cd Fashionista-Media

2. Start a Live Server:
   There are several ways to start a live server, depending on your preferences and the tools you have installed. One common method is to use the `live-server` npm package.
   If you don't have it installed globally, you can install it by running:
   npm install -g live-server
   Once `live-server` is installed, you can start the project by simply running:
   live-server
   This command will start a local server and open the Fashionista-Media project in your default web browser.
   

That's it! You should now have the Fashionista-Media project running locally on your machine using a live server.
